## Abstract
Join us for practical insight into the world of Camunda connectors, and learn how to best use them cleanly and efficiently
in low-code environments. Weâ€™ll look at the common challenges of using connectors and explain how to develop your own that
are sustainable and suited to specific needs of our business. We will also dive into development to understand the Camunda
connector ecosystem holistically, and put all the pieces of the puzzle together to design a holistic clean process architecture 
that can be operated sustainably and is future-proofed with Camunda connectors.
