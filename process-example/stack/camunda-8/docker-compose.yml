 # While the Docker images themselves are supported for production usage,
# this docker-compose.yaml is designed to be used by developers to run
# an environment locally. It is not designed to be used in production.
# We recommend to use Kubernetes in production with our Helm Charts:
# https://c8.docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/kubernetes-helm/
# For local development, we recommend using KIND instead of `docker-compose`:
# https://c8.docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/kubernetes-helm/#installing-the-camunda-helm-chart-locally-using-kind

# This is a lightweight configuration with Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, and Elasticsearch
# See docker-compose-all.yml for a configuration that also includes Optimize, Identity, and Keycloak.
