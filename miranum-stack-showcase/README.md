# Miranum Stack Showcase

This Showcase demonstrates our various tools, grouped under the **Miranum** brand.

1. [Miranum Platform](https://github.com/Miragon/miranum-platform)
   is a versatile workflow and process automation framework utilizing components like Camunda 7, a schema-registry and an intuitive task list.
2. [Miranum Connect](https://github.com/Miragon/miranum-connect)
   is a library which enables developers to build reusable and technology neutral connectors and integrations between products.
3. [Miranum IDE](https://github.com/Miragon/miranum-ide)
   provides a centralized hub for editing, managing and accessing process application artifacts via VS Code.

> Note: **Miranum** is still in an early stage of development. As such, there may be some bugs or missing features that will be implemented in the near future.
